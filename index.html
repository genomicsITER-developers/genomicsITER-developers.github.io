# HADA: automated annotation of next-generation sequencing data in hereditary angioedema studies

This repository presents HADA, a database for genetic variation related to Hereditary Angioedema, comprising several information for clinical interpretation of each reported mutation in pathogenesis development. The information was used to establish a database configured for ANNOVAR to be seamlessly incorporated into the routine NGS bioinformatics annotation. See list below:

## Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor or dysregulation of the kinin cascade. Because of its non-specific signs, HAE is poorly recognized in the clinical field, resulting in delayed diagnoses that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. To adapt its diagnosis to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assessments, we developed Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation (HADA) tool. Currently, HADA includes records for 416 simple causal variants in the five genes underlying HAE. However, 25% of those were classified as non-pathogenic by current guidelines, suggestive of a gap in the interpretation of disease variants and a necessity to improve the classifiers of pathogenicity potential of genetic variants.

We performed a manual curation and update to GRCh37/hg19 of the causal variants described to date in HAEdb and VarSome and classified all of them to the ACMG guidelines.

## Getting started 

### Requirements
Linux or macOS

### Install ANNOVAR
Download and install [ANNOVAR](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_download_form.php) according to the instructions

Once downloaded, unpack the package by using this command:

```
tar -zxvf annovar.latest.tar.gz
```

### Download HADA

In ANNOVAR folder, download HADA database and index files from repository:

```
cd annovar/humandb
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsITER-developers/HADA/master/releases/latest/hg19_hada_20190131.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsITER-developers/HADA/master/releases/latest/hg19_hada_20190131.txt.idx
```

## Usage

Annotate a VCF file using HADA:
```
perl <path-to-annovar-dir>/table_annovar.pl <path-to-vcf-infile> <path-to-annovar-dir>/humandb \
  -buildver hg19 \
  -out <path-to-vcf-outfile> \
  -remove \
  -protocol hada_20190131 \
  -operation f \
  -nastring . \
  -vcfinput
```
The resulting annotated VCF will be in `<path-to-vcf-outfile>.hg19_multianno.vcf`

**Note:** remember to replace the items in `<>` with your local paths in your computer.
